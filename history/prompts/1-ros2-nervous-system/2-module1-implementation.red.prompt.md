## Prompt

Implementation of Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) textbook content with academic rigor, clear explanations, and code examples.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) textbook content with over 2,500 words. The implementation includes:

1. Comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 core concepts and architecture
2. Detailed explanation of communication patterns (nodes, topics, services, actions)
3. Python integration with rclpy including practical examples
4. URDF creation and integration with simulation
5. AI agent integration patterns with behavior trees
6. Practical exercises with code examples
7. Proper academic citations in APA format
8. Clear diagrams and code blocks for Docusaurus
9. Structured content with headings and progressive complexity

The content addresses all requirements from the specification and plan, including research-based approach, academic rigor, and practical examples. All major ROS 2 components are explained with functional code snippets and integration examples.
