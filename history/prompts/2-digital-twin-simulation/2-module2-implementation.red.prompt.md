## Prompt

Implementation of Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) textbook content with academic rigor, clear explanations, and code examples.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) textbook content with over 2,500 words. The implementation includes:

1. Comprehensive coverage of digital twin fundamentals and concepts
2. Detailed explanation of Gazebo physics simulation with world files and sensor models
3. Unity environment creation with PBR materials, lighting, and robotics integration
4. Sensor simulation implementation for LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs in both environments
5. Integration techniques between Gazebo and Unity through ROS 2 bridges
6. AI agent integration with simulated sensors and perception systems
7. Practical exercises with code examples for multi-sensor environments
8. Proper academic citations in APA format
9. Clear diagrams and code blocks for Docusaurus
10. Structured content with headings and progressive complexity

The content addresses all requirements from the specification and plan, including high-fidelity simulation concepts, sensor integration, and AI perception systems. All major simulation components are explained with functional code snippets and integration examples.
