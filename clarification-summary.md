# Clarification Summary for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

This document summarizes all clarifications needed across the four modules of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

### CRITICAL Clarifications Needed:
1. **Ambiguous Terms**: Define "clearly" and "simple" for ROS 2 concepts
2. **Missing Prerequisites**: Specify assumed knowledge of Python, basic robotics, and Linux
3. **Incomplete Assessment**: Define how "90% success rate" is calculated
4. **Software Requirements**: Specify ROS 2 distribution and system requirements

### NICE-TO-HAVE:
1. **Learning Objectives**: Add explicit learning objectives per section
2. **Theory vs Practice**: Clarify balance between theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

### CRITICAL Clarifications Needed:
1. **Ambiguous Terms**: Define "high-fidelity" and "realistic" for environments and textures
2. **Missing Prerequisites**: Specify assumed knowledge of Gazebo, Unity, and 3D modeling
3. **Software Requirements**: Define specific versions of Gazebo and Unity and system requirements
4. **Assessment Criteria**: Define how "85% accuracy" is calculated for physics simulations
5. **Integration Details**: Clarify how Gazebo and Unity environments should work together
6. **Focus Balance**: Determine relative importance of Gazebo vs Unity in the curriculum

### NICE-TO-HAVE:
1. **Simulation vs Reality**: Define level of physical accuracy required
2. **Integration Approach**: Clarify relationship between simulation and real-world applications

## Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

### CRITICAL Clarifications Needed:
1. **Ambiguous Terms**: Define "photorealistic" and "bipedal humanoid movement" scope
2. **Missing Prerequisites**: Specify assumed knowledge of NVIDIA Isaac, CUDA, and AI frameworks
3. **Hardware Requirements**: Define NVIDIA GPU requirements and system specifications
4. **Assessment Criteria**: Define how "85% accuracy" is calculated for navigation
5. **LLM Integration**: Specify which LLMs to use and integration patterns
6. **Priority Balance**: Determine relative importance of Isaac Sim vs Isaac ROS

### NICE-TO-HAVE:
1. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Clarify challenges and approaches for transferring simulation results to real robots

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

### CRITICAL Clarifications Needed:
1. **Ambiguous Terms**: Define complexity of "natural language instructions" and "multi-step tasks"
2. **Missing Prerequisites**: Specify assumed knowledge of LLMs, computer vision, and speech processing
3. **API Access**: Define OpenAI Whisper access, costs, and rate limits
4. **Assessment Criteria**: Define how "85% accuracy" is calculated for voice commands
5. **Capstone Requirements**: Specify components and evaluation criteria for capstone project
6. **Integration Approach**: Clarify depth of Vision-Language-Action integration

### NICE-TO-HAVE:
1. **Learning Sequence**: Determine whether to teach modalities separately or as an integrated system

## Cross-Module Issues

### CRITICAL:
1. **Consistent Prerequisites**: Establish baseline knowledge requirements across all modules
2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Ensure modules build appropriately on each other
3. **Software Compatibility**: Verify all tools work together across modules
4. **Assessment Consistency**: Define consistent assessment criteria across all modules

### NICE-TO-HAVE:
1. **Cross-Module Integration**: Define how concepts from different modules connect
2. **Course Flow**: Establish clear progression from one module to the next
