# AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy and Scientific Rigor
All content must be technically accurate and grounded in established robotics, AI, and control theory. Factual claims must be supported by peer-reviewed sources, official documentation, or verifiable standards. No unverified claims or speculation should be presented as fact.

### Educational Clarity for STEM Learners
Content must be clearly written and accessible to undergraduate and graduate STEM students. Complex concepts should be explained with appropriate examples, diagrams, and step-by-step explanations that build understanding progressively from fundamentals to advanced topics.

### AI-Native Pedagogy
The textbook embraces AI-native learning approaches including agent-assisted learning, interactive simulations, and tool-assisted understanding. Content should be structured to work effectively with AI agents and modern learning tools.

### Reproducibility and Traceability
All technical claims, experiments, and examples must be reproducible. Sources must be properly cited using APA style, and all code examples, data, and methodologies must be traceable to their origins with clear attribution.

### Originality and Academic Integrity
All content must be original writing with 0% plagiarism. Proper attribution must be given to all sources, and no copyrighted material should be reproduced without permission. All examples and explanations must be created de novo.

### Visual Learning Support
Diagrams, equations, and practical examples must be included wherever they enhance understanding. Mathematical concepts should be presented with both symbolic notation and intuitive explanations to support different learning styles.

## Additional Standards

All factual claims must be cited using peer-reviewed papers, standards, or official documentation. Preferred citation style is APA format. The textbook must include diagrams, equations, and examples where applicable to support learning objectives. Content should be structured in a modular chapter format suitable for classroom use with clear learning objectives per chapter.

## Development Workflow

Content development follows a structured process with clear learning objectives, technical verification, and educational review. Each chapter must be independently reviewable and testable for both technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness. The Docusaurus framework with Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code tools must be used for content creation, versioning, and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation and technical decisions for the AI-Native Textbook project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require documented justification and approval from project maintainers. All content must be verified for compliance with these principles before acceptance.
