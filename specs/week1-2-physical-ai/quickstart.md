# Quickstart Guide: Week 1-2 Physical AI Content

## Overview
This guide provides a rapid introduction to the key concepts covered in Week 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI. It's designed for students to quickly grasp the fundamental concepts before diving into the detailed content.

## Key Concepts at a Glance

### 1. Physical AI vs. Digital AI
- **Digital AI**: Processes abstract data in computational spaces
- **Physical AI**: Interacts directly with the physical environment
- **Key Difference**: Physical AI must account for real-world physics and environmental interaction

### 2. Embodied Intelligence
- Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, brain, and environment
- The physical form influences cognitive processes
- Behaviors emerge from sensorimotor coupling

### 3. Essential Sensor Systems
- **LIDAR**: Creates 3D maps of the environment
- **Cameras**: Provide visual information for object recognition
- **IMUs**: Measure orientation and acceleration for balance
- **Force/Torque Sensors**: Enable safe physical interaction
