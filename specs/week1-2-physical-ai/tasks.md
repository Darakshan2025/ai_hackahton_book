# Tasks: Week 1-2 Physical AI Content

**Feature**: Week 1-2 Physical AI Content | **Date**: 2025-12-23 | **Branch**: master

## Summary

Generate 1,500+ word educational content for Week 1-2 covering Introduction to Physical AI with diagrams and examples. The content will explain embodied intelligence and Physical AI principles, describe key sensor systems (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors), and illustrate the transition from digital AI to humanoid robotics with practical examples.

## Implementation Strategy

MVP approach: Focus on core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence first, then expand to sensor systems and transition examples. Each phase builds on the previous one while maintaining independently testable increments.

## Dependencies

User Stories must be completed in priority order:
- Foundational content must be completed before advanced topics
- Core concepts before sensor systems
- Sensor systems before transition examples
