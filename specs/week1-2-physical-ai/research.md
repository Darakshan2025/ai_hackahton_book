# Research: Week 1-2 Physical AI Content

## Decision: Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence Focus
**Rationale**: Focusing on Physical AI and embodied intelligence provides a clear foundation for understanding how AI systems interact with the physical world, which is essential for humanoid robotics education.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure software AI focus (rejected - doesn't address physical interaction)
- Hardware-focused approach (rejected - lacks AI perspective)
- General robotics overview (rejected - too broad for focused learning)

## Decision: Sensor Systems Coverage
**Rationale**: Including LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors provides comprehensive coverage of the key sensing modalities used in humanoid robots, giving students practical understanding.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Limited sensor coverage (rejected - insufficient for robotics understanding)
- Theoretical-only approach (rejected - students need practical examples)
- Advanced sensor fusion only (rejected - too complex for introduction)

## Decision: Digital AI to Physical AI Transition Framework
**Rationale**: The transition framework helps students understand the evolution from traditional AI to embodied AI, providing historical context and conceptual clarity.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct Physical AI introduction (rejected - lacks context for students familiar with digital AI)
- Pure comparison approach (rejected - doesn't show evolution)
- Technology-focused approach (rejected - lacks pedagogical framework)

## Decision: Content Structure and Flow
**Rationale**: The chosen structure moves from abstract concepts to concrete applications, following educational best practices for complex technical subjects.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Technology-first approach (rejected - concepts need to precede technology)
- Problem-based approach (rejected - too advanced for week 1-2)
- Historical approach (rejected - less pedagogically effective)
