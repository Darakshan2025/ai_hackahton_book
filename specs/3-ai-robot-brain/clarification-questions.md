# Clarification Questions for Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## 1. AMBIGUOUS TERMS

### CRITICAL: "photorealistic simulation"
- **Issue**: "photorealistic" is subjective and not quantified
- **Clarification needed**: What specific visual quality standards define photorealistic in this context?

### CRITICAL: "bipedal humanoid movement"
- **Issue**: "bipedal humanoid movement" is broad - does this include walking, running, balancing, etc.?
- **Clarification needed**: What specific types of bipedal movement should be covered?

## 2. MISSING ASSUMPTIONS

### CRITICAL: Prerequisites
- **Issue**: No mention of assumed knowledge of NVIDIA Isaac, CUDA, or AI frameworks
- **Clarification needed**: What prior experience with AI frameworks, NVIDIA tools, or computer vision should students have?

### CRITICAL: Hardware Requirements
- **Issue**: No mention of NVIDIA GPU requirements or system specifications
- **Clarification needed**: What NVIDIA hardware is required? What are the minimum system specs?

## 3. INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL: Assessment Criteria
- **Issue**: Success criteria mention "85% accuracy" for navigation but don't define measurement approach
- **Clarification needed**: How is navigation accuracy calculated? What constitutes successful path planning?

### CRITICAL: LLM Integration Details
- **Issue**: No specific guidance on which LLMs to use or how to integrate them with Isaac
- **Clarification needed**: Which specific LLMs should be implemented? What integration patterns should be followed?

## 4. SCOPE CONFLICTS

### CRITICAL: Isaac Sim vs Isaac ROS Priority
- **Issue**: Module covers both Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS but doesn't clarify their relationship
- **Clarification needed**: Should students focus equally on both, or is one more important than the other?

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Simulation vs Real-World Application
- **Issue**: Module mentions simulation but doesn't clarify how findings transfer to real robots
- **Clarification needed**: How should students understand the sim-to-real transfer challenges?
