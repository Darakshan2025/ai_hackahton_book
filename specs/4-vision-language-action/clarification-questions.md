# Clarification Questions for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## 1. AMBIGUOUS TERMS

### CRITICAL: "natural language instructions"
- **Issue**: "natural language" is broad - what complexity and domain of language should be supported?
- **Clarification needed**: What types and complexity of natural language instructions should the system handle?

### CRITICAL: "multi-step tasks"
- **Issue**: "multi-step" is undefined - how many steps constitute a multi-step task?
- **Clarification needed**: What is the minimum and maximum complexity of multi-step tasks?

## 2. MISSING ASSUMPTIONS

### CRITICAL: Prerequisites
- **Issue**: No mention of assumed knowledge of LLMs, computer vision, or speech processing
- **Clarification needed**: What prior experience with AI models, vision systems, or NLP should students have?

### CRITICAL: API Access and Costs
- **Issue**: No mention of OpenAI API access, costs, or rate limits
- **Clarification needed**: How should students access OpenAI Whisper? What are the usage constraints?

## 3. INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL: Assessment Criteria
- **Issue**: Success criteria mention "85% accuracy" for voice commands but don't define measurement approach
- **Clarification needed**: How is voice command accuracy calculated? What constitutes correct action mapping?

### CRITICAL: Capstone Project Scope
- **Issue**: Capstone project is mentioned but lacks specific requirements and evaluation criteria
- **Clarification needed**: What specific components must be included in the capstone? How is it evaluated?

## 4. SCOPE CONFLICTS

### CRITICAL: VLA Integration Approach
- **Issue**: Module mentions Vision-Language-Action but doesn't clarify how deeply they should be integrated
- **Clarification needed**: Should these be separate systems that communicate, or a unified architecture?

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Single vs Multi-Modal Learning
- **Issue**: No guidance on whether to teach modalities separately or jointly
- **Clarification needed**: Should students learn each modality independently first, or learn them as an integrated system?
