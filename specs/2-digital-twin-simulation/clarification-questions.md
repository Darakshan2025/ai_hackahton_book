# Clarification Questions for Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)

## 1. AMBIGUOUS TERMS

### CRITICAL: "high-fidelity environments"
- **Issue**: "high-fidelity" is subjective and not quantified
- **Clarification needed**: What specific elements define a high-fidelity environment? What level of detail is expected?

### CRITICAL: "realistic textures and lighting"
- **Issue**: "realistic" is subjective
- **Clarification needed**: What makes textures and lighting realistic in this context? Are there specific technical requirements?

## 2. MISSING ASSUMPTIONS

### CRITICAL: Prerequisites
- **Issue**: No mention of assumed knowledge of Gazebo, Unity, or 3D modeling
- **Clarification needed**: What prior experience with simulation environments or game engines should students have?

### CRITICAL: Software Requirements
- **Issue**: No specific versions or system requirements for Gazebo and Unity
- **Clarification needed**: What versions of Gazebo and Unity should be used? What are the minimum system requirements?

## 3. INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL: Assessment Criteria
- **Issue**: Success criteria mention "85% accuracy" but don't define how this is measured
- **Clarification needed**: How is accuracy calculated for physics simulations? What constitutes correct behavior?

### CRITICAL: Integration Details
- **Issue**: No specific guidance on how Gazebo and Unity environments should work together
- **Clarification needed**: Should these be used independently or in combination? How do they integrate?

## 4. SCOPE CONFLICTS

### CRITICAL: Gazebo vs Unity Focus
- **Issue**: Module covers both Gazebo and Unity but doesn't clarify their relationship
- **Clarification needed**: Should students learn both equally, or is one primary with the other as supplement?

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Simulation vs Reality Balance
- **Issue**: No guidance on how closely simulations should match real-world physics
- **Clarification needed**: What level of physical accuracy is required for educational purposes?
