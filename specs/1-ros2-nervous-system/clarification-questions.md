# Clarification Questions for Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

## 1. AMBIGUOUS TERMS

### CRITICAL: "ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services concepts clearly"
- **Issue**: "clearly" is subjective and not measurable
- **Clarification needed**: What specific level of understanding is expected? Should students be able to implement custom nodes, or just understand the concepts?

### CRITICAL: "simple publisher-subscriber system"
- **Issue**: "simple" is undefined
- **Clarification needed**: What constitutes a simple system? How complex should the example be?

## 2. MISSING ASSUMPTIONS

### CRITICAL: Prerequisites
- **Issue**: No mention of assumed knowledge of Python, basic robotics, or Linux
- **Clarification needed**: What prior knowledge should students have before starting this module?

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Hardware/Software Requirements
- **Issue**: No specific requirements for ROS 2 installation, system specs, or dependencies
- **Clarification needed**: What ROS 2 distribution should be used? What system requirements are needed?

## 3. INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL: Assessment Criteria
- **Issue**: Success criteria mention "90% success rate" but don't define how this is measured
- **Clarification needed**: How is success rate calculated? What constitutes a successful implementation?

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Learning Objectives
- **Issue**: No explicit learning objectives beyond success criteria
- **Clarification needed**: What should students be able to do after completing each section?

## 4. SCOPE CONFLICTS

### NICE-TO-HAVE: Theory vs Practice Balance
- **Issue**: Module mentions both conceptual understanding and practical implementation
- **Clarification needed**: Should focus be more on theoretical understanding or hands-on implementation?
